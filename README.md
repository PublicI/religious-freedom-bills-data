## About this data release

This spreadsheet contains a list of copycat bills found using the Center for Public Integrity's model legislation tracker, which analyzed nearly a million bills to detect common language and identify model legislation. The descriptions and metadata are from [Legiscan](https://legiscan.com/), which was a source for the tracker.

The spreadsheet includes 541 copycat bills from 49 states. The language used in many of these bills appears rooted in a  legislative playbook known as Project Blitz and laid out in a document titled "Report and Analysis on Religious Freedom Measures Impacting Prayer and Faith in America." The playbook was first made available to the public in 2017 by the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, a non-profit religious organization with hundreds of lawmaker-members in Congress and statehouses nationwide.

The latest version of the playbook, from 2018, includes 148 pages of strategy, talking points and model language designed to push laws that instill Judeo-Christian principles in public schools and other governmental institutions.
