> About this data release

This spreadsheet contains text of state legislation  collected from Legiscan that was analyzed using the Center for Public Integrity's model legislation tracker which analyzed nearly a million documents to detect common language and flag model legislation.

The spreadsheet includes 541 copycat bills from 49 states. The language used in many of these bills appears rooted in a broader legislative playbook formally called the "Report and Analysis on Religious Freedom Measures Impacting Prayer and Faith in America," known as Project Blitz. The playbook was first made available to the public in 2017 by the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, a non-profit religious organization with hundreds of lawmaker-members in Congress and statehouses nationwide.

The latest version of the playbook, from 2018, includes 148 pages of strategy, talking points and model language for legislators designed to push laws that instill Judeo-Christian principles in public schools and other governmental institutions.
